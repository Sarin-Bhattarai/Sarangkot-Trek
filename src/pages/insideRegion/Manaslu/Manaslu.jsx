              Manasu Circuit Trek
            </h1>
            <p>
              The Manaslu Circuit trek is a demanding trekking route located in
              Nepal's Gorkha district, providing stunning views of the Himalayan
              mountain range, cultural experiences, and an opportunity to
              explore remote villages. Beginning in Arughat, the trail follows
              the Budhi Gandaki River, passing through Jagat, Deng, Namrung, and
              Samagaon before reaching the Larkya La Pass, the highest point of
              the trek at 5,160 meters. The trek offers magnificent views of the
              eighth highest mountain in the world, Manaslu, as well as other
              peaks like Himal Chuli, Shringi, and Ngadi Chuli. Additionally,
              the trek offers the chance to learn about the local culture and
              customs of various ethnic groups like the Nubri and Tsum people.
              The trek usually takes around 14-18 days and requires a good level
              of physical fitness and prior trekking experience. To ensure a
              safe and organized trek, it is recommended to go with a licensed
              trekking agency and guide who can arrange permits, accommodations,
              meals, and guarantee your safety throughout the trek.

              Manaslu and Tsum Valley Trek
            </h1>
            <p>
              The Manaslu and Tsum Valley trek is a popular route in Nepal that
              combines the Manaslu Circuit and Tsum Valley treks. It's a unique
              opportunity to experience two distinct regions with different
              cultures, traditions, and natural beauty. The trek begins in
              Arughat, following the Budhi Gandaki River through remote villages
              and challenging terrain. As it passes through the Manaslu
              Conservation Area, trekkers can appreciate the stunning scenery of
              snow-capped mountains and varied flora and fauna. The Tsum Valley
              is a sacred Himalayan pilgrimage area in the north of Gorkha
              district, near Tibet, featuring ancient monasteries, chortens, and
              mani walls. The Tsumba people, who have maintained their unique
              culture for generations, inhabit the valley. The trek usually
              lasts between 20-25 days and demands a good level of physical
              fitness and prior trekking experience since it involves crossing
              high mountain passes like Larkya La (5,160 meters) and Ngula
              Dhojhyang Pass (5,093 meters). It is strongly recommended to use a
              licensed trekking agency and guide to guarantee the necessary
              permits, accommodations, meals, and overall safety during the
              trek.

              Tsum Valley Trek
            </h1>
            <p>
              The Tsum Valley trek is a well-known trekking route in Nepal,
              celebrated for its unusual cultural heritage, breathtaking
              scenery, and isolated position. The valley is located in the
              northern part of the Gorkha district and is surrounded by three
              mountain ranges: Sringi Himal, Ganesh Himal, and Boudha Himal. The
              trek starts in Arughat, and then moves upstream along the Budhi
              Gandaki River into the Tsum Valley. The Tsumba people, who have
              protected their age-old traditions and customs for many
              generations, live in the valley. The Tsum Valley features small
              villages, ancient monasteries, and chortens (stupas) and provides
              awe-inspiring views of the Himalayan Mountains. Along the way,
              trekkers will visit Philim, Chumling, and Chhekampar, some of the
              area's small villages. They will also see the Mu Gompa monastery,
              one of the oldest and most significant monasteries in the Tsum
              Valley.
